Get your portfolio base set up!

- Fork this repo.

- Break out the different style sections from style.css into individual CSS files. You should end up with base.css, common.css, 320.css, 480.css, 768.css, and 1140.css.

- Get rid of the orange theme and replace with one of your choosing (can just be black/white for now if you're feeling uninspired).

- Add personal-type links to the header nav. Some combination of twitter, Tumblr, Facebook (*shudder*), contact, about, etc. 

- Add a nav to the #main div. This nav should hold links to your portfolio pieces (which we'll be building out with future assignments). You'll probably need/want to shrink the main article and aside to fit this in.

- Add a small profile picture in the footer.

- Repeat header links in the footer.
